# Galaga: CS120B Final Project
This is my final project for CS120B. I recreated the arcade classic, Galaga,the complexities used were: 1 x joystick, 1 x led matrix, 2 x shift registers, 1 x LCD screen with EEPROM and custom character capabilities. The game allows the player to move on an x-axis and the player can shoot the enemy ships by pressing down on the joystick (functions as a button). The highest score will be saved on the lcd and in-game instructions will be displayed which will guide the player through the start menu. The game is over when both ships are destroyed or the player's ship is destroyed.
